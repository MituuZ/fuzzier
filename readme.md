A simple plugin to allow "fuzzy" file search with the UI inspired by [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)

If you are interested in plugin development you can check out my write-up about creating Fuzzier in 
[here](https://mituuz.com/content/fuzzier_development.html).

Supports spaces in the search string, splitting the string and searching for both parts separately. 
e.g. parts do not need to be in the correct order, as long as both succeed on their own.

When having a project open with multiple modules, the module folder is prepended to the file paths. 
This might be somewhat unstable as modules do not have a definite root folder. 
Current implementation uses the first content root.

![The UI consist of three parts. A file list on the top left, search field on the bottom left and the preview pane on the right](assets/FuzzierUI.png "An image of the plugin UI")

## Usage
You can open Fuzzier with a shortcut or from the Tools menu. There is an action to fuzzy search over all files or over
only VCS tracked files.

Double-clicking a list item opens the file

When focused on the search field, you can use:
- Arrow keys to move up and down
- CTRL + j to move down (modifiable through keymap)
- CTRL + k to move up (modifiable through keymap)
- Enter to open the currently selected file

List movement can be remapped from settings -> keymaps, but do not support chorded shortcuts.

### File operations
Fuzzier can be used to move files using the same search to locate the file and target directory that is used for 
searching files. File Mover defaults to current file when search string is empty.

## Documentation
For a more thorough documentation of the plugin, please refer to the [Fuzzier Wiki](https://github.com/MituuZ/fuzzier/wiki).

The goal is to have a central place for all the documentation and to keep the README as a quick reference.

## Shortcuts
### Adding ideavim mapping for the plugin
Example of a .ideavimrc-row to add a vim keybinding for the plugin
```
map <Leader>pf <action>(com.mituuz.fuzzier.Fuzzier)
map <Leader>gf <action>(com.mituuz.fuzzier.FuzzierVCS)
map <Leader>mf <action>(com.mituuz.fuzzier.FuzzyMover)
```

### Adding an editor shortcut

## Contributing
I have a tendency to make some larger refactors from time to time, 
so I would appreciate it if you would open an issue before starting to work on a feature or a bug fix.

I'll help as I can and can give guidance on how to implement the feature or fix the bug, 
but cannot guarantee that I will accept the PR.
